# Kellekto-Culinary-Design

Some designs I made for Kellekto Culinary (Instagram @kellekto_culinary)

Kellekto Culinary is accepting food orders by the system of Pre-Order in Surabaya, Indonesia

The designs are made using Adobe Photoshop and PhotoPea, utilizing skills that I just learned while doing my ICT Professional Year at Monash College.
I am still learning and will produce more design that will be updated here.

*Update: Started learning to use Illustrator too now and implement it at work. Design is copyrighted by the company I'm working currently.
